## Arxena website


### Clone code in your local system
```
 git clone https://github.com/yagyaraj234/arxena-site
```

### Move to arxena directory

### Run 
```
npm install
```

### Start the server
```
npm run dev
```


## Other way 

I have created a new file in base directory name called `newserver.py` which point to the dist directory in arxena directory 

Which is a build file of a react appliaction.

```
 python newserver.py
```


### Thank you
